###Supply list:
*1 [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno)
*1 type B USB cable
*2 breadboards
*2 8x8 LED Matrices with attached driver chip - we used [these](https://www.creatroninc.com/product/8x8-led-matrix-board/)
*2 pushbuttons
*~20 wires (we also used some female wire to extend

1.Ensure that the [Arduino software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) is installed.

2.Install the LED Matrix Library
The library we used to work with the LED matrices (LedControlMS) was made by [Makespace Madrid](http://makespacemadrid.org/).
We pulled the library from this [Instructables page] (http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Matrix-with-Arduino/).
We've also included the library here. You will have to place the library folder into the Program Files > Arduino > Libraries.

3. Refer to included Fritzing diagram for wiring instructions.
