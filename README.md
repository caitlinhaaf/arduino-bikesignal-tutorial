IMM Sheridan Technology Studio Project - Chanelle F., Caitlin H., Lucey K.


The library we used to work with the LED matrices (LedControlMS) was made by [Makespace Madrid](http://makespacemadrid.org/).
We pulled the library from this [Instructables page] (http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Matrix-with-Arduino/).
We've also included the library here.
